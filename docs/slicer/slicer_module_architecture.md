# Slicer Module Architecture

This document summarizes Slicer module architecture concepts used by the STRATUM prototype.

## Core Concepts

3D Slicer is built around:

- the Slicer application core;
- the MRML scene;
- modules and extensions;
- libraries such as Qt, VTK, ITK, CTK, Python, and NumPy.

The current project uses a Python scripted loadable module because it provides full Slicer API access with a fast Reload and Reload and Test development loop.

## MRML Scene

The MRML scene is the shared data model for Slicer.

Important concepts:

- Data is stored in MRML nodes.
- Display properties belong in display nodes.
- Storage information belongs in storage nodes.
- Modules should communicate mainly through MRML nodes rather than direct module-to-module dependencies.
- Important workflow state should not live only in UI widgets.

Processing logic may read from and write to MRML nodes, but it should validate inputs before changing scene state.

## Module Entry Point

The module entry point should define:

- title;
- categories;
- contributors;
- help text;
- acknowledgement text;
- startup setup or sample-data registration when needed;
- public exports needed by Slicer.

Do not put feature logic in the module metadata class.

## Widget Responsibility

The widget is responsible for:

- loading the Qt `.ui` file or constructing UI controls;
- connecting buttons, selectors, and other signals;
- reading current UI values;
- calling logic methods;
- displaying results and validation messages;
- synchronizing UI state with a parameter node when one is used.

The widget should not contain processing algorithms, file parsing, or reusable computation.

## Logic Responsibility

The logic class is responsible for:

- computation;
- input validation;
- MRML node inspection;
- measurements and coordinate conversion;
- data conversion;
- report or result helpers when they are not UI-specific.

Logic should not depend on the widget. Logic methods should be callable from the UI, tests, another module, or the Python console.

Use passive logic by default: the widget creates or owns the logic instance, and the logic acts only when called. Add scene observers or background behavior only when a task requires them.

## Test Responsibility

Scripted-module tests should exercise logic and important integration paths. Prefer tests that can run without manual UI clicking.

Tests should use synthetic data, public Slicer sample data, anonymized test data, mock results, or explicitly approved public medical data.

## Parameter Nodes

Parameter nodes store module state in the MRML scene.

Use a parameter node when:

- settings must survive scene save and load;
- multiple inputs are linked as workflow state;
- UI state must stay synchronized with MRML state;
- the workflow is too complex for transient widget-only state.

Avoid adding parameter-node complexity before the workflow needs persisted state.

## Qt UI Files

For scripted modules with a `.ui` file, keep UI layout in `Resources/UI/` and behavior in the widget class.

After changing a `.ui` file, Reload may be enough. Restart Slicer if the UI does not refresh cleanly.

## Common Mistakes

- Putting all feature logic in the widget.
- Letting logic depend on widget controls.
- Storing important state only in UI fields.
- Changing MRML nodes without validating inputs.
- Ignoring units or coordinate systems in names.
- Adding real clinical or algorithmic claims before validation boundaries exist.
- Adding dependencies or sample data without an approved task.
